# Homework questions for Cantera Introduction Assignment

1. Create and include the adiabatic flame temperature plot for methane-air flames at 10 atm pressure. 
   - Why do the flame temperatures calculated deviate more for the fuel-rich cases than the fuel-lean cases?
2. Create and include the methane-air product species concentration plot as a function of temperature.
   - What happens to the concentration of CO and CO<sub>2</sub> as the temperature increases?
   - Why does the CO concentration decrease more from its maximum value than the other species?
3. Create and include the species concentration plot as a function of inlet temperature for the well-stirred reactor with an equivalence ratio of 0.5.
   - If you were a designer looking to create an engine that operated at the conditions simulated and wanted to reduce NO<sub>x</sub> 
   emissions what temperature would you consider designing the apparatus to operate at? Don't worry about any physical limitations of the device materials or operating conditions.
4. Create and include the species concentration plot as a function of residence time for the well-stirred reactor with an equivalence ratio of 0.25.
   - If you wanted to maximize the throughput of a combustor (this is also applicable to chemical process reactors) but maintain complete reactions
   what residence time would you choose based on the information in this plot?
